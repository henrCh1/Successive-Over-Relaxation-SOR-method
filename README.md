# Successive-Over-Relaxation-SOR-method
本程序使用Python编写，采用超松弛迭代法（SOR）求解线性方程组。通常情况下，雅可比迭代的收敛速度较慢，因此在工程中不太常用。而当雅可比迭代收敛速度非常缓慢时，使用高斯-赛德尔方法也并不能显著加快速度。然而，通过对高斯-赛德尔方法进行一定的修改，我们可以提高其收敛速度。改变相关参数并重新定义方程组，可以以指定的精度求解指定的线性方程组。代码中有详细注释，方便您更好地理解其内容。/
"This program is written in Python and uses the Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) method to solve linear equations. Generally, the Jacobi iteration converges slowly, so it is not widely used in engineering applications. Additionally, when the Jacobi iteration converges very slowly, using the Gauss-Seidel method may not significantly increase its speed. However, by making certain modifications to the Gauss-Seidel method, we can improve its convergence rate. By changing the relevant parameters and redefining the equation set, we can solve the specified linear equation set with a designated accuracy. The code contains detailed comments to help you better understand the content."
